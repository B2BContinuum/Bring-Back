# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Community Delivery feature enables users to check-in to locations they're visiting and offer delivery services to other community members. Users can announce where they're going, and other users can request items to be picked up and delivered. This creates a peer-to-peer delivery network that leverages existing trips to provide convenient, cost-effective delivery services.
